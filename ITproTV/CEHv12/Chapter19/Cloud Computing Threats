OWASP Top 10 Cloud Security Risks 
R1-Accountability and Data Ownership: Possibility of jeopardized data recovery that may result in critical risks due to public cloud usage.
R2-User Identity Federation: No control over multiple user IDs and creds.
R3-Regulatory Compliance: Complex Compliance. Different countries, different laws.
R4-Business Continuity: 



Domain Hijacking: Stealing a domain name from its legitimate owner.
Cybersquatting: Registering a domain name similar to a legitimate one with the intention of phishing or scamming users.
DNS Poisoning: Redirecting users to a fake website by manipulating the DNS server or cache.
Domain Snipping: Registering a domain name immediately after it expires.
Privilege Escalation: Unauthorized users gaining higher access rights due to system vulnerabilities.
Illegal Access to the Cloud: Unauthorized entry into cloud services due to weak authentication and authorization controls.
Isolation Failure: Unauthorized access to cloud data due to security isolation breakdowns.
Modifying Network Traffic: Altering network communication due to provisioning flaws or encryption vulnerabilities.
Service Hijacking Using Social Engineering Attacks: Gaining access to cloud services by stealing credentials through social engineering methods.
Wrapping Attack: Duplicating SOAP message bodies in the TLS layer to impersonate legitimate users.
DNS Attack: Attacking DNS to acquire authentication credentials from internet users.
Side Channel Attack: Compromising cloud security by placing a malicious virtual machine near a target server and launching an attack.
Cloudborne Attack: Exploiting vulnerabilities in bare-metal cloud servers to implant malicious backdoors.
Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) Attack: Exploiting vulnerabilities to access metadata of cloud instances and gain unauthorized access.
Cache Poisoned Denial of Service (CPDoS)/Content Delivery Network (CDN) Cache Poisoning Attack: Causing denial of service by poisoning CDN caches with malicious or error-based content.
Cloud Snooper Attack: Compromising AWS security groups to extract sensitive data stealthily.
Fragmentation Attack: Overloading a web server with large fragmented packets to consume excessive resources.
Slowloris Attack: Denying service by sending partial HTTP requests to fill up the target server's connection pool.
Golden SAML Attack: Exploiting SAML tokens to forge identity assertions and gain unauthorized access to cloud networks. Federation, SSO.
Cloud Snooper Attack: Compromising AWS security groups to extract sensitive data stealthily.

MITC Attack: Cloud file sync abuse, data compromise, C&C, remote access.
Cloud Hopper: MSP breach, remote access, lateral movement, IP theft.
Cloud Cryptojacking: Unauthorized mining, cloud misconfigurations, profitability.
Cloudborne: Firmware backdoor, persistent, bare-metal cloud servers.
Side-Channel Attack: Data theft, shared resources, virtual machine proximity.
Cybersquatting: Phishing, domain similarity, cloud service providers.
