Inverse TCP scan - manipulating tcp the way it works to determine if the port is closed
  using other flags like:
    fin
    urg
    push
    rst
    null = no flag set

open ports don't repond to fin, urge, push, or null
close ports repond with a rst instead

  tools:
nmap
hping3

sudo nmap -sF [targetIP] -> open|filtered could be firewall dropping packets, not closed but there's a possibility that it's closed
  -sF = scan Fin

sudo hping3 -8 8888-8890 -F [targetIP] -> Not responding ports: 8888 -> now, the change of this port is open is higher
  -8 = --scan = scan
  -F = fin

sudo nmap -sF [targetIP]
  -sF = null scan

sudo hping3 -c 2 -V -p 8888 -s 4444 -Y [targetIP] -> 100% packet loss; possibly open -> change port "-p 8889" -> 0% packet loss; close 
  -y = ymas = no flag set

sudo nmap -scanflags FINURG [targetIP]
  multiple flags scan

sudo hping3 -8 1-65335 -F -S -U -P -R
  -F = fin
  -S = syn
  -P = push
  -U = urg
  -R = rst
  -A = ack
  -X = xmas = opposite of null, ymas scan
  -Y = ymas

XMAS scan opposite of ymas or null scan
  lighting up like a xmas tree with fin push urge flags

"sudo nmap -SX [targetIP]" = "sudo nmap -scanflags FINPUSHURG"
