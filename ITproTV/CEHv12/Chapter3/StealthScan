Doesn't do 3 way handshake

SYN scan, initializes -> receives syn ack -> consider it open -> sends rst packet
half open handshake

nmap's default scan

there's also manual
kali -> "sudo nmap -sS  [target]" -> password -> same result as before but faster

or use hping3
  "hping3 --scan [portRange] -S [targetIP]" or hping3 -8 [portRange] -S [targetIP]
    --scan = -8
    -S = syn
