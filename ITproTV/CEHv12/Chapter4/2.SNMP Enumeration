Simple Network Management Protocol 
  system of communication, relays status information back to the server, OS independent as long as it supports SNMP

managers
agents - run on each device - informs managers
traps - informs agents of an event
community string - password, default "public", "private" another common with read write access
MIB - management information database, database of objects that can be managed by SNMP. uses OID, object identifier

              Tools:
161 tool - because snmp uses port 161
  in kali type "onesixtyone" -> onesixtyone [targetIP] -> result shows you what kind of machine it is and OS
  
snmp-check
  snmp-check [targetIP] -> result gives a lot

nmap too; look it up: cd to home directory (~) -> type "ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep snmp" 
  sudo nmap -sU -161 --script snmp-win32-users.nse [targetIP] -> and you get the list of users

snmpwalk - another one
  snmpwalk -c public -v1 [targetIP]
    add OID acquired from previous scan, looks like this -> snmpwalk -c public -v1 [targetIP] 1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25
