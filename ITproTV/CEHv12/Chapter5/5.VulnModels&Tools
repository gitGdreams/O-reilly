                            VulnAssessment Methods
Product-base method - Scanning software or hardware installed in organization's internal network. Organization has complete control. No outside assessment.

Service-based method - maybe the product of the future, offered by third parties. Some solutions are hosted inside the network, others outside the network. 

Tree-based Assessment - multiple different types of scans, based on the role of each machines

Inference-based assessment - scan first, see what they got, build inventory of protocols found on the machine. Next scan will depend on the first scan.

                            VulnAssessment Tools:
host-based - installed on base, vulnerabilities on that specific machine

Depth assessment - looking for new vulnerabilities, fuzzers

Application-layer tools - Nikto, to scan web application itself. other tools, skipfish
