DLL Hijacking
  Taking advantage of not using fully qualified path.
    have a malicious DLL ready -> look for real.dll -> Change malicious dll's name into name of real.dll -> place it in the application directory ->
      if path is not specified, when the user run the application will execute dll in the same directory as the application which is the fake real.dll  -> 
        once executed, attacker now have gained remote access to the system.
      Use Robber and PowerSploit to detect hijackable DLLs and perform DLL hijacking on the target system

Dylib hijacking - same as DLL hj but MacOS version

Unattended installation - might contain administrative password
  unattended.xml files: 
    C:\Windows\Panther\ 
    C:\Windows\Panther\ UnattendGC\ 
    C:\Windows\System32\ 
    C:\Windows\System32\sysprep\

Unquoted service paths - spaces in between the Names of the folder
  New Folder instead of "New Folder" 
    Attackers exploit services with unquoted paths running under SYSTEM privileges to elevate their privileges





===============================================
Meltdown vulnerability: This is found in all the Intel processors and ARM processors deployed by Apple. 
  This vulnerability leads to tricking a process to ACCESS OUT-BOUND memory by exploiting CPU optimization mechanisms such as speculative execution.

Dylib hijacking: This allows an attacker to inject a malicious dylib in one of the primary directories and simply load the malicious dylib at runtime.

Spectre vulnerability: Spectre vulnerability is found in many modern processors such as AMD, ARM, Intel, Samsung, and Qualcomm processors. 
  This vulnerability leads to tricking a processor to exploit SPECULATIVE execution to read restricted data. The modern processors implement speculative execution to predict the future and to complete the execution faster.

DLL hijacking: In DLL hijacking attackers place a malicious DLL in the application directory; the application will execute the malicious DLL in place of the real DLL.



C:\Windows\system32>nltest /domain_trusts: 
  Attackers use this utility to collect information about trust domains and use the gathered information to add a domain trust or 
    modify the settings of existing domain trusts to escalate privileges through Kerberoasting and pass-the-ticket attacks.
C:\Windows\Panther\ UnattendGC\: 
  Unattended installs allow attackers to deploy Windows OSs without the intervention of an administrator. 
    In Windows systems, the Unattend.xml file is stored in the above location.
\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\: 
  Attackers use this path to access the domain group policies and modify them to perform unintended activities such as creating a new account, disabling or 
    modifying internal tools, ingress tool transfer, unwanted service executions, and modifying the policy to extract passwords in plaintext.
C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe: 
  Attackers create persistence and escalate privileges by embedding and running malicious code within Windows accessibility features. 
    On-screen keyboard is an accessibility feature abused by attackers.


  Defend against the Abuse of sudo Rights
Implement a strong password policy for sudo users.
Turn off password caching by setting timestamp_timeout to 0 so that users must input their password every time sudo is executed.
Separate sudo-level administrative accounts from the administratorâ€™s regular accounts to prevent theft of sensitive passwords.
Update user permissions and accounts at regular intervals.
Test sudo users with access to programs containing parameters for arbitrary code execution.
