chi-square - probability test whether the given stego object and original data, same or not
Chosen-messsage - generates stego objects
known-cover - compares stego-object and cover medium to identify the hiidden message
distinguishing statistical - analyzes the embedded algorithm 

Stego-only: no access to any info except the stego medium or stego-object
Chosen-message: uses known message to generate a stego object
Chosen-stego: when the steganalyst knows both the stego-object and steganography tool or algorithm used to hide the message
